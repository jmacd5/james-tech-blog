      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction-the-complexity-crisis&#34;&gt;1. Introduction: The Complexity Crisis&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The corporate network is undergoing an invisible but radical expansion. It no longer resides within the fixed geography of a data center; it has become a distributed capability stretching across multiple public clouds, edge environments, and increasingly, complex AI models. As this infrastructure sprawls, the traditional concept of a &amp;ldquo;perimeter&amp;rdquo; is becoming a dangerous myth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The vanguard of enterprise security has moved toward a &amp;ldquo;Hybrid Mesh Firewall&amp;rdquo; architecture to address a fundamental shift in the threat landscape. Traditional security measures are buckling under the weight of two inescapable realities: over 90% of enterprise traffic is now encrypted, and the emergence of Generative AI has created a primary target that firewalls were never designed to see. To survive this era, security must evolve from a collection of isolated points into an intelligent, unified fabric.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
