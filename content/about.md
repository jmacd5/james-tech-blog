## Why NetCryptix?

The name reflects the intersection of **networking** and **cryptography** - the foundation of modern secure infrastructure. Every design I create prioritizes:

1. **Security by Design** - Not bolted on as an afterthought
2. **Operational Excellence** - Solutions that teams can actually manage
3. **Scalability** - Architectures that grow with the business
4. **Compliance-First** - Meeting regulatory requirements from day one
